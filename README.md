a fully responsive website built with React.js and TypeScript! 🌐💻

🔍 With meticulous attention to detail, I've created a sleek and user-friendly design that adapts seamlessly to any screen size

📽️ To give you a glimpse of what's in store, I've put together a video showcasing the website's features and functionalities.
